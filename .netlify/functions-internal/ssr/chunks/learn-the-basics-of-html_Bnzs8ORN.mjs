Understanding the basics of HTML is essential for anyone who wants to build and design web pages. In this post, we will explore the key concepts and elements of HTML.\n\n## Introduction to HTML\n\nHTML is a markup language that uses a set of tags to structure the content of a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, and they define the structure and appearance of the content. HTML documents are composed of a head and a body. The head contains meta-information about the page, such as the title and character encoding, while the body contains the visible content.\n\n## Document Structure\n\nEvery HTML document starts with a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration, which specifies the version of HTML being used. The `<html>` tag is the root element of an HTML page. Inside the `<html>` tag, we have the `<head>` and `<body>` tags. The `<head>` tag contains meta-information, while the `<body>` tag holds the visible content.\n\n## Headings and Paragraphs\n\nHeadings are structural elements used to organize content hierarchically. HTML provides six levels of headings, from `<h1>` (the highest level) to `<h6>` (the lowest level). Paragraphs are defined using the `<p>` tag.\n\n## Text Formatting\n\nHTML offers various tags to format text. The `<b>` tag is used for bold text, while the `<i>` tag is used for italic text. The `<u>` tag underlines text, and the `<s>` tag represents strikethrough text. Additionally, the `<sup>` and `<sub>` tags are used for superscript and subscript text, respectively.\n\n## Links\n\nLinks enable users to navigate between web pages. The `<a>` tag is used to create a link. The `href` attribute defines the destination URL. To open the link in a new browser tab, the `target` attribute with the value `_blank` can be used.\n\n## Images\n\nImages bring life to web pages. The `<img>` tag is used to insert images into an HTML document. The `src` attribute specifies the source URL of the image, while the `alt` attribute provides alternative text that is displayed if the image cannot be loaded.\n\n## Lists\n\nHTML supports ordered and unordered lists. The `<ol>` tag is used for ordered lists, where each item is marked with a number. The `<ul>` tag represents unordered lists, where each item is marked with a bullet point. List items are defined using the `<li>` tag.\n\n## Tables\n\nTables are useful for presenting data in a structured format. The `<table>` tag is used to create tables, while the `<tr>` tag defines a table row. Within each row, the `<td>` tag is used to create table cells. Table headings can be defined using the `<th>` tag.\n\n## Forms\n\nForms allow users to input data on a webpage. The `<form>` tag is used to create a form. Input elements, such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and buttons, are defined inside the form using respective tags like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<checkbox>`, `<radio>`, and `<button>`.\n\n## Semantic Elements\n\nSemantic elements provide meaning to the structure of an HTML document. Examples of semantic elements include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`. These elements help search engines and screen readers understand the content better.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHTML is the backbone of the web. Understanding the basics of HTML is crucial for anyone involved in web development or design. In this post, we covered the fundamental elements of HTML, including document structure, headings, paragraphs, text formatting, links, images, lists, tables, forms, and semantic elements.
